## 7. Reverse Number

Given a signed 32-bit integer <code>x</code>, return <code>x</code> with its digits reversed. If reversing <code>x</code> causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range <code>[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]</code>, then return <code>0</code>.

<b>Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).</b>
