## 75. Sort Colors

Given an array <code>nums</code> with <code>n</code> objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code> to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
