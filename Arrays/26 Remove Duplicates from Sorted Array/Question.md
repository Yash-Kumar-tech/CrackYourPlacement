## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array <code>nums</code> sorted in <b>non-decreasing order</b>, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The <b>relative order</b> of the elements should be kept the <b>same</b>. Then return the number of unique elements in <code>nums</code>.

Consider the number of unique elements of <code>nums</code> to be <code>k</code>, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array <code>nums</code> such that the first <code>k</code> elements of <code>nums</code> contain the unique elements in the order they were present in <code>nums</code> initially. The remaining elements of <code>nums</code> are not important as well as the size of <code>nums</code>.
Return <code>k</code>.
