## 48. Rotate Image

You are given an <code>n x n</code> 2D <code>matrix</code> representing an image, rotate the image by <b>90</b> degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. <b>DO NOT</b> allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
