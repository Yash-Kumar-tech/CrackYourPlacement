## 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a <b>0-indexed</b> integer array <code>nums</code>, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to <b>any of the peaks</b>.

You may imagine that <code>nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž</code>. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in <code>O(log n)</code> time.
