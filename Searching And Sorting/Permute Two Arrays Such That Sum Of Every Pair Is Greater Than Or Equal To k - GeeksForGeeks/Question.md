## Permute Two Arrays Such That Sum Of Every Pair Is Greater Than Or Equal To k - GeeksForGeeks

Given two arrays of equal size n and an integer <code>k</code>. The task is to permute both arrays such that sum of their corresponding element is greater than or equal to <code>k</code> i.e <code>a[i] + b[i] >= k</code>. The task is to print “Yes” if any such permutation exists, otherwise print “No”.
